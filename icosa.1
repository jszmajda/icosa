.TH ICOSA 1 "2026-02-15" "demomotd" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
icosa \- bouncing glenz vector over a checkerboard floor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icosa
.RB [ \-h | \-\-help ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B icosa
renders a spinning tetrakis hexahedron (the "glenz vector" from demoscene
tradition) bouncing on a perspective checkerboard floor, inspired by the
iconic scene from
.IR "2nd Reality" " (Future Crew, 1993)."
.PP
The shape is drawn as a braille-dot wireframe in the alternate screen buffer
at approximately 30 fps. Physics-based bouncing includes gravity, damping,
and squash-and-stretch deformation on impact.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Normal exit (keypress, signal, or help).
.TP
.B 1
Terminal too small (minimum 20\[mu]10) or unknown option.
.SH USAGE WITH DEMOMOTD
.B icosa
is one of several terminal effects selectable by
.BR demomotd (1),
a Fish shell greeting function. When invoked through demomotd, it runs
inside
.BR timeout (1)
for 2\[en]3 seconds and exits cleanly via SIGTERM.
.PP
It can also be run standalone:

.SH RENDERING
Each terminal cell is mapped to a 2\[mu]4 grid of braille dots (Unicode
block U+2800\[en]U+28FF), giving an effective resolution of
.RI 2\[mu] cols " \[mu] 4\[mu]" rows
pixels.
Edges are rasterized with Bresenham's line algorithm.
.PP
The checkerboard floor uses 256-color background attributes
(dark grey and light grey) with
.B 1/t
perspective projection.
.SH GEOMETRY
The tetrakis hexahedron is a Catalan solid with 14 vertices, 36 edges,
and 24 triangular faces. It can be constructed by raising a shallow pyramid
on each face of a cube. In the demoscene, this shape (rendered with
translucent face blending) is known as a "glenz vector."
